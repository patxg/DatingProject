## Setting up Jupyter lab
We will go over this together. I will write this up. - Pat

### Extension
make sure you install it will make life easier
```conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions```
* Snippets - Snippets does not write your code for you! Itâ€™s only there to provide editable templates for boilerplate code.  Easier than google
* Variable Inspector - I frequently assign a variable, but then forget to return its value from the cell or add a print function to see it, so I edit and re-run the cell. This helps prevent that.
* Scratchpad - provides one cell for you to use, but the idea is to use it for one-off checks and tests. You can even display charts with matplotlib. But be warned: any operations you perform or variables you assign can and will affect the state of your notebook! Will create global variables
* Gist-it - provides a shortcut to save the current Notebook as a Github Gist
//
### Libraries
* numpy
* maplotlib
* pandas
